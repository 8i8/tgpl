          This is an important question to ask but not one that can be answered easily nor
quickly, any simple explanation would be all to readily cast aside by the
discerning mind as a belief or superstition. Yet this practise, its accompanying
doctrine, are from their core foundation deeply scientific; Who then among us,
that is truly of a scientific inclination, would not be intrigued to learn of
any such thing as a science that bears the fruit of a predictive capacity, fully
capable of withstanding the rigorous testing of the scientific method? Before
any real understanding of this science might arise in the mind of the student,
as is so for any other, one must begin by learning some of the language, the
tools and techniques required to begin to explore and communicate the inherent
depths of this wonderful subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is also worthy of mention, I think that perhaps you will agree, that any
scientific mind deserving of their accolade, should be quite aware today of the
conundrum that is currently posed by the imperfections of the standard model;
How the field of physics and its main stay tool mathematics, are today rather at
a loss to describe their own innate limits, limits which are present in the very
fruits of the practice; It is for this reason that I hope to spark some interest
in the reader, that they consider this somewhat differing approach to scientific
study and maths. To assist in the understanding of such as the oddities as the
quantum state or the strangeness of the neuroepigenome that requires such
divisive models as these; All of which seeming to never quite manage to fully
describe the system. These terms and models, in time, have become accepted as
fact by the more junior scholar and are thus often questioned no further, this
is not so in the practice of jyotiṣa which always seeks to keep the students
mind alert to the very limited nature of any teaching. A quintessential
difference perhaps between the two schools, please do feel free to prove me
wrong on this score; I long for only that.

        <p>
          In essence the main difference between jyotiṣa and modern physics is a differing
models and different teaching methods, the foundations thus are so far removed
the one from the other, that it is hard for any who are deeply schooled in one
discipline, to understand the thought process required to grasp the other, often
rejecting it outright as superstition all the while accepting premises of
another doctrine as truth; Both however are in every way as difficult to grasp
and to explain rationally. Take the widely used standard model of the atom for
example, this notion requires that one collapse their own thought down into one
dimension in order that it make any sense; Yet still we find ourselves imagining
the world, built from these tiny one dimensional blocks; This notion itself is
erroneous, we are in effect applying this one dimensional model to three spacial
dimensions those that we perceive so easily with our eyes, rather than just the
one dimension that is required to be justified by the limited mathematical
tools. This is however, a very normal behaviour, one which I have no gripe with,
I request only that you, dear reader, bear in mind this thought; The knowledge
is still only a model, and has never been considered to be an established fact
by those who understand and use it. That there might be some room left in your
minds eye, to consider the possibilities and implications of another. A model
that might also serves us well in our quest understand the marvels of the world
in which we live; It is my contention that these two differing scientific
approaches are much closer today than one might first think.

          Jyotiṣa is the origin of the mathematical system that we use today introducing
both the numerals and the concept of 0 as the decimal placeholder and the so
called Arabic numerals originate from here by way of Arabian exploration of
India in the distant past; This concept of 0 is itself a very intricate one, and
śūnya is not ascribed lightly, paradoxically it is that light is also known by
another term, śakti; However this little divergence is of a rather profound in
nature, that I shall not attempt to explore with you dear reader, just yet. In
essence jyotish uses a less rigid more colourful number system than that of
western physics, this facet it would seem, is one of the major factors keeping
the two disciplines form communicating with each other, or the practitioners of
one from understanding the perspective of practitioners of the other.

          So where to start? We are approaching a highly advanced subject, a science that
can take many years, some say many lifetimes, to learn; To refine such a topic
into a perspective for the beginner for lay person, the uninitiated. To be
honest this is not at all an easy thing to do with out sounding, in English,
like airy-fairy spiritual type or a religious fanatic, thought these terms are
them selves born of another bread of fanaticism; I ask only that the reader keep
an open mind throughout, try to assimilate the ideas presented as best they can,
until such a time as, dear reader, you have a fare enough understanding of the
subject at hand to really make up your own mind and not to propagate the
thoughts of any other; I will make this promise to you now, the understanding
gleaned from the study of this wonderful science, is well worth the mental
effort required to assimilate its foible’s, the required thought patterns at
first a challenge, once assimilated are a delight to explore. I shall try to
keep my comparisons framed in a perspective that is understandable to one who
has studied western decimal based mathematical science; The mathematical base of
Jyotiṣa some what less linear, as is it usage. I also apologise to any who are
spiritually inclined, though I think that your inclination will lead you to
understand my predicament, in attempting to appeal to the broadest base of
reader, that you will as such by the way of your own fair nature be able to
excuse any apparent dryness in my words that this approach might instigate,
please forgive my brashness in this circumstance; I hold nothing but admiration
for your perspective.
